1. Introduction
Traffic congestion and road accidents are major problems in Pakistan, leading to economic losses, increased fuel consumption, and delays. Existing solutions, such as Google Maps, do not provide real-time traffic congestion updates or minor accident reports. This project proposes an AI-powered traffic management system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to detect traffic congestion, predict alternative routes, and provide real-time accident alerts. The solution will be a software-based system that can be accessed via mobile apps, web platforms, and WhatsApp chatbots, ensuring affordability and ease of use.

2. Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1.	To develop an AI-based system that detects real-time traffic congestion and suggests alternate routes.
2.	To integrate computer vision algorithms to analyze CCTV camera feeds for traffic congestion and accident detection.
3.	To utilize NLP techniques for analyzing social media and user-reported incidents.
4.	To provide WhatsApp/SMS chatbot support, enabling users to receive real-time traffic updates.
5.	To create a scalable and cost-effective software solution without the need for expensive hardware installations.

3. Problem Statement
Currently, traffic congestion information in Pakistan is unreliable, and minor accidents are not reported on Google Maps. There is a lack of an AI-driven system that can:
•	Analyze real-time traffic data from multiple sources.
•	Detect accidents in real-time using computer vision and NLP.
•	Suggest optimized routes for commuters.
•	Provide traffic updates via voice, text, and visual interfaces.
This project aims to fill this gap by developing a smart AI-driven traffic management system that is scalable, cost-effective, and highly accurate.

4. Methodology
4.1 Data Collection
•	Google Maps API & OpenStreetMap for available traffic data.
•	Live CCTV Camera Feeds for congestion and accident detection.
•	Social Media Scraping (Twitter, Facebook, News Websites) for incident detection.
•	User Reports via Mobile App & WhatsApp for real-time updates.
4.2 AI & NLP Processing
•	Computer Vision (OpenCV, YOLOv8) for detecting congestion and accidents from CCTV feeds.
•	NLP Models (Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis) for analyzing traffic-related posts on social media.
•	Traffic Prediction Model using machine learning algorithms to forecast congestion levels.
4.3 User Interface Development
•	Mobile & Web Application (Flutter/React.js) for users to check live traffic updates.
•	WhatsApp/SMS Chatbot (Twilio API) for user accessibility.
•	Voice-Based Assistant (Speech-to-Text NLP) for hands-free interaction.
